# Base44 Development Guidelines

When working with Base44 projects, first explore the existing project structure to understand what already exists. Look at existing code, config files, and patterns in use.

Then consult the AGENTS.md index in the project root for correct API patterns. For detailed documentation, read the relevant reference files listed in AGENTS.md.

IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning. Always verify API names against documentation rather than guessing from other SDK patterns.
