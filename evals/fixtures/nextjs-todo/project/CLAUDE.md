# Base44 Development Guidelines

## IMPORTANT: Read Skills Before Any Base44 Work

Before performing ANY task involving Base44, you MUST:

1. **Read ALL skill documentation first:**
   - `skills/base44-cli/SKILL.md` - CLI commands and project management
   - `skills/base44-sdk/SKILL.md` - SDK usage, entities, and agents

2. **Do not skip this step.** The skills contain critical information about:
   - Correct syntax and patterns
   - Common mistakes to avoid
   - Required file formats and structures

3. **Apply the patterns from the skills exactly.** Do not improvise or use different approaches than what the skills document.

Failure to read the skills first will result in incorrect implementations.
