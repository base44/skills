description: "When implementing features in a Base44 project (base44/ folder exists with config.jsonc), you MUST use this skill. First explore the project, then read AGENTS.md and relevant reference docs before writing code. Base44 APIs have unique names - do NOT guess from Firebase/Supabase patterns. Covers: entities CRUD, auth, agents, functions, integrations."

See AGENTS.md in the project root for a compressed documentation index.
