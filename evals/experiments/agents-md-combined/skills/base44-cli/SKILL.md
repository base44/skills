description: "When configuring Base44 resources (entities, functions, agents) or initializing/deploying projects, you MUST use this skill. First explore the project, then read AGENTS.md and relevant reference docs before writing configs. Entity names are PascalCase, agent names are snake_case, function entry field is 'entry' not 'entrypoint'. Covers: project create, deploy, entity/function/agent push."

See AGENTS.md in the project root for a compressed documentation index.
Reference docs are in the references/ directory.
