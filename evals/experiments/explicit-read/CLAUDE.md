# Base44 Development Guidelines

When working with Base44 projects, always read the relevant skill documentation before making changes:

- Before using Base44 CLI commands, read `skills/base44-cli/SKILL.md`
- Before working with Base44 SDK (entities, agents, etc.), read `skills/base44-sdk/SKILL.md`

This ensures you follow the correct patterns and avoid common mistakes.
