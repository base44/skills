# Example Skill

This is a placeholder skill created to test the `readme-check` GitHub Actions workflow.

It exists solely to verify that the workflow correctly detects a new skill directory and updates the README's "Available skills" table.

## Usage

There is no real usage — delete this skill after testing.
